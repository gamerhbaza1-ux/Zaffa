/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-related data is private and can only be accessed by the user who owns it. The default security posture is to deny all access unless explicitly granted.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized hierarchically. Each user has a primary document in the top-level `/users` collection. All of their associated data, such as checklist items, is stored in subcollections under their user document (e.g., `/users/{userId}/checklistItems/...`).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only ever read or write data within their own document tree (`/users/{userId}/...`).
 * - No User Listing: It is not possible for any client to list all documents in the `/users` collection, protecting user privacy.
 * - Ownership Integrity: On creation, documents must include an ownership field (e.g., `userId`) that matches the authenticated user's ID. This field is immutable and cannot be changed on update, ensuring ownership can never be transferred.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The `ChecklistItem` document contains a denormalized `userId` field. This allows security rules to authorize access by checking a field on the document itself, which is significantly more performant and scalable than checking its parent document.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: User data is naturally segregated by the `/users/{userId}` path, which provides a secure and efficient way to manage and query user-specific information without any risk of data leakage between users.
