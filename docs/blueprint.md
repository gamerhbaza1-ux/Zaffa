- Background color: Very light pink (#FDF3F6) for a gentle backdrop that keeps the design airy and uncluttered.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#BEE3F8) as a contrast, ensuring readability without overpowering the gentle color scheme.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality; suitable for both headlines and body text
- Use elegant and simple icons for categories and actions to match the minimalistic design.
- A clean and responsive layout that adapts well to all screen sizes, especially mobile devices.
- Subtle animations like a gentle fade-in effect for newly added items, or a celebratory shimmer upon marking an item as purchased.
